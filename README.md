## Introduction
### Libot: Autonomous Mobile Manipulation Robot for Libraries
In this final year project, we proposed Libot. Libot is a mobile manipulation robot designed to automate tasks in library environments. Combining the capabilities of the UR5 robotic arm and MiR250 mobile platform, enhanced with a Realsense 435i depth camera, Libot autonomously navigates and interacts within library settings.

### Feature
- **Book Detection System:** Utilizes the YOLO v8 deep learning model to recognize book spine labels from RGB images, facilitating efficient book cataloging.
- **Deep-learning-based Object grasping:** Integrated with the [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/) platform through move group API to optimize book handling through precise pick-and-place operations. Deep-learning algorithm [GPD](https://github.com/atenpas/gpd?tab=readme-ov-file) by [Andreas](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/atp/) is used for grasp generation.
- **SLAM Mapping and Navigation:** Enhanced with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to adapt to dynamic library layouts, improving navigation and operational efficiency. Mapping through hectoring mapping by [TeamHector](https://www.teamhector.de/) at TU Darmstadt.
